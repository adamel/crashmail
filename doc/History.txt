Changes in version 0.4

 - First public release
 
Changes in version 0.42

 - Fixed bug that occurred when sending mail to nodes with long addresses 
   (e.g. 9999:8888/7777.6666)
	
 - Fixed an error message in the outbound handling
 
 - Fixed a bug that occurred when auto-adding pass-through areas

 - Fixed a small memory leak

 - CrashMail got caught in an infinite loop when an unknown nodelist format
   was specified in the config. This is now fixed.
	
 - CrashMail no longer segfaults at startup when pass-through areas are used!
 
 - CrashMail now adds packets to bundles in the correct order
 
 - CrashMail would under some circumstances use the same bundle for more than
   one node. This has been fixed and a mechanism that checks that the same
   bundle is not used for more than one node has been added.

 - Routing did not work properly when BOUNCEPOINTS was turned on. Fixed. 

 - Removed an unnecessary linebreak from the bounce messages.

 - New configuration keyword: NOMAXOUTBOUNDZONE. See example.prefs for more
   information.

 - CrashList did not handle Pvt nodes correctly. Fixed.

 - There was a small mistake in the example configuration file. The keyword is
   REMOTEAF, not REMOTEAREAFIX.
