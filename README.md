CrashMail II
============

This was originally Johan Billing's *CrashMail II* distribution.  I
have introduced some minor bug fixes, and removed much of the
non-Linux support.

If you run into any problems with this code, plase report them to
the [project bugtracker][bugs].

Compiling
---------

To compile CrashMail II, run `make`:

    make

To run the test suite:

You will need [Roundup][] to run the tests.
